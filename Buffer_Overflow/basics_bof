The x86 architecture does contain 8 general registers that are used to store data and then can address that point to other positions in the memory
EBP (base pointer)
ESP (stack pointer)
EAX (accumulator)
EBX (base)
ECX (counter)
EDX (data)
EDI (destination index)
ESI (source index)


EIP: Extended Instruction Pointer. This is a read-only register and does contain the address of the next instruction to be executed (tells the CPU what to do next).
ESP: Extended Stack Pointer. Points to the top of the stack (at any time) at the lower memory location.
EBP: Extended Base Stack Pointer. Points to higher address (last item) at the bottom of the stack.
